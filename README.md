Visos is the brand new community driven operating system designed to optimise user experience.
The MBR will run another file located in the boot secter which will prepare the environment for the kernel.
It uses assembly code for the boot loader and is compiled using nasm and linked with ld. The kernel is written in C and compiled with gcc, the Gnu Compiler Collection. The iso image is built using Java 11 and the Jiic library.
